## 🤝 Credits & Powered By
This project stands on the shoulders of giants. It is built using the following open-source technologies:

*   **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/):** For the rapid, interactive web application framework.
*   **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/):** For high-performance numerical calculations.
*   **[numpy-stl](https://pypi.org/project/numpy-stl/):** For handling STL mesh generation and manipulation.
*   **[Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/):** For the interactive 3D rendering engine.
*   **[PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/):** For packaging the application into a standalone Windows executable.

*Inspired by parametric knob discussions on [Maker Forums](https://forum.makerforums.info/).*
